# ShinyCWP

ShinyCWP is a fanmade desktop client (which is more like a simplified browser) that will let you play ShinyColors with some ease. The project is quite new, and we're still working to deploy more features. Please help us suggesting features you think would be cool or reporting bugs.

We're currently working with developers in [Hiori](https://github.com/shinycolors/Hiori) to translate menus and dialogs in the game as much as possible. If you wish to help and know Japanese or image editing, please support them, too.

### Features
  * Minimal interface.
  * Less resource intensive.
  * Automatic japanese connection setup (*optional*).
  * Game sound on non-focused window (*optional*).
  * Always-on-top mode.
  * Fullscreen mode.
  * Account log-off (*cookie deletion*).
